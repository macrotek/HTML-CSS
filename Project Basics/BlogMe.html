				<p> One of the main defects of the Indian agricultural marketing is the presence of too many middleman 
				and exploitation of farmers by them. On one hand these middlemen exploit the farmers by purchasing the produce
				at lower prices and on the other hand they exploit the customers by demanding higher prices from them. 
				The only aim of number of commission agents, brokers etc. is to derive a higher income from the middle 
				processes. These middlemen take undue advantage of the poor farmer on the basis of their financial resources.</p>
